   Backend top bar

#. To the left is the icon for **minimizing the Module Menu**.
#. You already met the next icon on the left. It is for
   :ref:`collapsing the page tree <collapse-page-tree>`.
#. Moving on to the next icon, we have the **TYPO3 CMS logo**
   (which can be modified by an extension,
   as the Introduction Package does).
   Then comes the **name of your site** (this is part of global
   configuration, which is described later).
#. The star icon will open a list of **Bookmarks**. Every time
   you see such an icon in the TYPO3 CMS backend, you can click on it
   and the current view will get saved to this list of bookmarks.
#. The lightning bolt icon opens the **Clear Cache** menu to flush the various
   caches that are used by TYPO3 CMS to improve performance.
   Caches are described in detail in TYPO3 Explained::ref:`t3api:caching`.
#. The question mark icon opens the **Help** menu, which gives access
   to various modules related to help and documentation.
#. The next icon opens up a panel showing various information
   about the current **system** and TYPO3 CMS installation.
#. The user name is displayed next. It opens a menu giving access
   to the **"User Settings"** module, where you can change your password
   and various preferences. Here is also the "Logout" button.
#. Finally, we have a general **"Search"** field, which will search
   through all records (pages, content elements, users, etc.) existing
   in the current TYPO3 CMS installation.
