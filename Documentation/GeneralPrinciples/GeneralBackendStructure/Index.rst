General Backend Structure
=========================

Here is a complete overview of the general backend structure.

Top bar (top)
   This gives you access to your user settings, logout, search
   etc.

Module menu (left)
   This is the main menu of the TYPO3 CMS backend. It is divided
   into main modules (:guilabel:`WEB`, :guilabel:`FILE`, etc.) and
   their sub-modules.

Page tree (middle)
   This can be used to browse through and select pages.

Content area (right)
   This is where you can edit pages and content elements.

Docheader (top)
   This contains the action icons, like close, save or preview,
   some general information and sometimes a drop-down menu with
   further actions.
