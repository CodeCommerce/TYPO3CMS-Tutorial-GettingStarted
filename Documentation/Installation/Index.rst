Prerequisite
============

For trying out TYPO3 CMS you need to have a fully configured and ready
to use web server which meets the `minimum system requirements
<https://get.typo3.org/version/9#system-requirements>`_.

If you do not have a web server and you are running a MS Windows
on local your machine, you might want to try the `TYPO3Winstaller
<http://typo3winstaller.sourceforge.net/>`_, which will install a web
server and TYPO3 CMS on your computer.

Make sure to have your database credentials ready.
