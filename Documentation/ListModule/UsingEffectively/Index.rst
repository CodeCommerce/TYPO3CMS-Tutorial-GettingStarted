=================================
Using the List Module Effectively
=================================

Choose the **WEB > List** module and place yourself on the
"Congratulations" page. You should see the following:

The list view typically shows the list of records present on the
current page, grouped by type. The name which appears for each record
depends on which field is used as label. For "pages", the field is
"Pagetitle".

The list view offers a lot of action icons in the **Docheader**:

#. **Create** a new record (a wizard appears to let choose which type)

#. **View** the current page (in the frontend)

#. **Edit** the current page

#. **Search** in the current page

#. **Clear the cache** of the current page

#. **Refresh** the List view

#. **Bookmark** this view

#. Access **contextual help**

In the **Content Area**, there are also some action icons:

#. Create a **new page record** (specifically)

#. Action icons for the record. What icons appear here depends on the record
   type. If the record is viewable in the frontend (as "pages" are), a "View"
   icon is displayed. All records will have the next three icons, respectively
   "Edit", "Hide/unhide" (i.e. visible in the frontend or not) and "Delete".

   The ellipsis icon (three consecutive dots) expands the icon list to show
   additional action icons (typically for accessing information, moving around, etc.)

   Last come the cut and paste icons.

If you want to always see the expanded list of icons, you can check the
**"Extended view"** box at the bottom of the view (please scroll down).

Also make sure that the **"Show clipboard"** box is checked, as we will explore
this next.

If you plan to manage a multilingual web site, you will want to also
check the **"Localization view"** checkbox.
